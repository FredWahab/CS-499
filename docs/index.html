      <h3>Self-Introduction</h3>
      <p>I originally began my academic journey at SNHU by earning an Associate of Science in Information Technology, 
        and afterward chose to continue into the Computer Science program, where I have been enrolled for several years 
        progressing through both theoretical and applied coursework. During this time, I have gained critical skills in 
        full-stack web development using frameworks such as MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js), database design and 
        integration with both SQL and NoSQL systems, and core software engineering principles such as modular architecture, 
        system design, and testing. For my capstone enhancements, I plan to demonstrate my ability to design maintainable applications, 
        implement efficient algorithms and data structures to solve real-world problems, integrate secure databases, and clearly 
        communicate technical concepts through documentation and visuals. These enhancements will showcase modular refactoring, optimized 
        data-processing routines, robust CRUD functionality, and secure coding practices, all of which directly support my career goal of 
        becoming a full-stack developer. By highlighting not only my technical coding ability but also my design thinking, data modeling, 
        and user-centered problem solving, I will be aligning my work with the skills most sought after by software development employers. 
        Ultimately, enhancing my artifacts in the areas of software engineering, algorithms, and databases will allow me to specialize 
        in building scalable, secure, and user-friendly applications, further strengthening my focus on end-to-end full-stack development.</p>
